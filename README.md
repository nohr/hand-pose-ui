# Hand Pose Estimation controlled UI

This project is a prototype of a user interface that can be controlled by hand gestures. It uses the [MediaPipe Hand Landmarker](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/hand_landmarker/web_js#video) task to estimate the hand pose and then uses the landmarks to control the UI.

This repo's initial commit was of my progress as of February 2023. Since then, the MediaPipe team had introduced major updates to their API accessing the hand pose estimation model. I'll be adapting the code then adding more use cases beyond navigation.
